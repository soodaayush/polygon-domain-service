![buildspace](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5732eb1c-35b9-4a2d-af0f-33965fc0ff2d)

## Inspiration

This is a project created by Buildspace called "Build your own domain service on a Polygon L2 in a weekend", which I decided to take on and create.

## Challenges Faced

Understanding the intracacies of the Polygon L2 blockchain.

## Lessons Learned

Learned about domain registration on the blockchain and how to manage those said domains.

## The Website

This website is a decentralized domain name service built on Polygon's Layer 2 blockchain. It allows users to register, manage, and resolve domain names in a decentralized manner, leveraging the scalability and low transaction costs of the Polygon network.
